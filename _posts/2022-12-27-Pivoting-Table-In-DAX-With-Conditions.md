title: Pivot data with filetrs and conditions using DAX
#subtitle:

Assuming we have bank balances categorized by bank and account type, our goal is to aggregate the balance by BankGroup for each AccountType based on a specific criterion. The criterion involves summarizing the raw data by bank group and account type, and then adding up only the positive balances for each bank group.

In order to do that, first we need to pivot data by bankgroup and accountype. Then we only sum positive balance which means replace negative balance by 0 then sum it up. The data would look like this:

Again, re-run one more pivot table to aggregate bank balance by bank group. The final output would be

If youâ€™re following so far, we have understood the problem statement as well as solution workflows. Now, we are going to write a single DAX function to perform pivot table operation as mentioned above. 

### **Step 1: Group raw data by Account Type.**
```
VAR CheckingData =
    FILTER (
        'DataTable',
        'DataTable'[AccountType] = "Checking"
    )
VAR SavingData =
    FILTER (
        'DataTable',
        'DataTable'[AccountType] = "Saving"
    )
```

### **Step 2: Perform Pivot operation for each group and treat negative balance using IF() operation and save it as new VAR.**

```
VAR PositiveCheckingBalance =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        SUMMARIZE (
            'DataTable',
            'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance",
                IF (
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] ) <= 0,
                    0,
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] )
                )
        ),
        KEEPFILTERS ( CheckingData )
    ) 

// Sum positive balance for Saving AccountType  
VAR PositiveSavingBalance =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        SUMMARIZE (
            'DataTable',
            'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance",
                IF (
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] ) <= 0,
                    0,
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] )
                )
        ),
        KEEPFILTERS ( SavingData )
    )

```

### **Step 3: Append PositiveCheckingBalance and PositiveSavingBalance save appended table as new VAR.**
```
VAR CombineTable =
    // SELECTCOLUMN() function keeps column in specific order
    UNION (
        SELECTCOLUMNS (
            PositiveCheckingBalance,
            "Bank Group", 'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance", [Bank Balance]
        ),
        SELECTCOLUMNS (
            PositiveSavingBalance,
            "Bank Group", [BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance", [Bank Balance]
        )
    )
```

### **Step 4: Step 4: Finally, Summarize the union table by BankGroup and RETURN final output.**
```
RETURN
    SUMMARIZE (
        CombineTable,
        [Bank Group],
        "Bank Balance",
            SUMX (
                FILTER (
                    CombineTable,
                    [Bank Group]
                        = EARLIER ( [Bank Group] )
                ),
                [Bank Balance]
            )
    )
```
The above code will return following output which identical to Pivot Table in Excel.

## Here is a complete code as a one function: 

```
Non-Negative Bank Balance By Account Type = 
//Separate data by Account Type 
VAR CheckingData =
    FILTER (
        'DataTable',
        'DataTable'[AccountType] = "Checking"
    )
VAR SavingData =
    FILTER (
        'DataTable',
        'DataTable'[AccountType] = "Saving"
    )

// Pivoting Data 
// SUM Bank Balance if balance is positive for each account type. 
// Sum positive balance for Checking AccountType 
VAR PositiveCheckingBalance =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        SUMMARIZE (
            'DataTable',
            'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance",
                IF (
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] ) <= 0,
                    0,
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] )
                )
        ),
        KEEPFILTERS ( CheckingData )
    ) 
// Sum positive balance for Saving AccountType  
VAR PositiveSavingBalance =
    CALCULATETABLE (
        SUMMARIZE (
            'DataTable',
            'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance",
                IF (
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] ) <= 0,
                    0,
                    SUM ( 'DataTable'[Balance] )
                )
        ),
        KEEPFILTERS ( SavingData )
    ) 
// Append Calcualted Table and save it as new VAR because 
// we will have to aggregate balance by Bank Group later 
VAR CombineTable =
    // SELECTCOLUMN() function keeps column in specific order
    UNION (
        SELECTCOLUMNS (
            PositiveCheckingBalance,
            "Bank Group", 'DataTable'[BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance", [Bank Balance]
        ),
        SELECTCOLUMNS (
            PositiveSavingBalance,
            "Bank Group", [BankGroup],
            "Bank Balance", [Bank Balance]
        )
    ) 
// Pivot data to aggregate balance by BankGroup
RETURN
    SUMMARIZE (
        CombineTable,
        [Bank Group],
        "Bank Balance",
            SUMX (
                FILTER (
                    CombineTable,
                    [Bank Group]
                        = EARLIER ( [Bank Group] )
                ),
                [Bank Balance]
            )
    )
```
